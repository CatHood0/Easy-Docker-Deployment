## Easy-Auto-Deploy CLI-tool version

TODO (at this week as soon as possible):

- Add the pipelines that are required for common deploy cases
- Add basic commands to execute basic deploy with the example
- Remove current services, and convert them to a new part of the pipelines, to avoid executing another stages if them no pass (improve error handling)
- Test pipelines
- Implement project capabilities, and yaml parser
